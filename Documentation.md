This is a documentation to a script named random.sh:
The main purpose of the script is to output numbers from 1 to 10 in random order after every execution of file named random.sh:
Tests:
Execution №1:
$ ./random.sh
10
6
7

Execution №2:
$ ./random.sh

For example if we change value in one of our arrays for example we will write:
array[9]=F instead of an array[9]=10, we will get the following error:
./random.sh: line 19: [: F: integer expression expected
Or if we write the number that is too big for example if we write:
array[9]=99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 instead of an array[9]=10, we will get the following error:
./random.sh: line 19: [: 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999: integer expression expected
After all of these tests i came to a conclusion that the script works currectly and if it works currectly than you don't have to touch it BECAUSE IT WORKS CURRECTLY!!!!. So just use it for your own purposes and don't break anything.
